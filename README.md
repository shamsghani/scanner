# Image Processing Library

The Image Processing Library is a Python library that provides functions for preprocessing images, detecting and approximating corners of objects, and applying perspective transformations.

## Installation

To use this library, you can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install image-processing-library
```

## Usage

```python
from image_processing_library import process_image

# Provide the path to the input image
image_path = "path/to/your/image.jpg"

# Process the image
process_image(image_path)
```

## Functions

### 1. `preprocessing(image)`

Preprocesses the input image by converting it to grayscale, applying Gaussian blur, thresholding, and morphological operations.

```python
morph_image = preprocessing(image)
```

### 2. `corner_get(morph)`

Detects and approximates the corners of the object in the processed image.

```python
corners_result = corner_get(morph_image)
```

### 3. `warp(image, corners)`

Applies a perspective transformation to the input image based on the detected corners.

```python
warp(image, corners_result)
```

### 4. `process_image(image_path)`

Processes an image using the provided image path, combining the above functions.

```python
process_image("path/to/your/image.jpg")
```
